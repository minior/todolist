PLANNING

NEXT STEPS
    - accountcreate: empty.
    - index: start populating html / javascript actual todolist
    - login: form of login page -> php sections

features / parts
1. SQL
    - database with diff users and logins
    - database of items for each user + state of whether completed (many to 1 r/s)
        - deadlines included in database + date completed (1 to 1)

CREATE DATABASE todolist;

GRANT ALL ON todolist.* TO 'jedo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'minior';
GRANT ALL ON todolist.* TO 'jedo'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'minior';

CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username varchar(255),
    password varchar(255),
);

CREATE TABLE tasks (
    task_id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    task varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    status BOOL NOT NULL,
    deadline DATE
    user_id INTEGER,
    CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (user_id) 
        ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
);
    

    
2. php to retrieve from server info + user verification + sessions
 - php page to show previously completed tasks (READ)

3. simple html to have checkbox that upon clicking, checks off task 
    - also include colour change
        PROBLEM- how to run js stuff only if logged in -> perhaps idh to. I can just run the code to retrieve sql components and add them (see crud app from coursera javascript course)

4. have a page with all completed tasks and date completed (phase 2)

UNSURE PARTS:
    login.php: use of POST to redir w user_id
